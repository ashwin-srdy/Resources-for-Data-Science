What’s up! I’m Ashwin Sangareddypeta and it’s been 2 years since I started my journey in machine learning. Following are the resources I referred for learning stuff, making and breaking stuff. I’ve included YT channels, playlists and websites where you can find datasets, codes, hackathons also link of courses have been included below.
Have fun exploring!
I hope you’ll find this PDF helpful ;)
